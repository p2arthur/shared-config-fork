Open for questions! The repository link is on screen for follow-up, and I'm happy to help with initial setup if anyone wants to adopt this. Real questions are the best feedback for improving the repo. Edge cases you encounter are likely things we should document. Thank you for attending; feel free to reach out async via GitHub issues.
