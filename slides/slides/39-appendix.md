# Appendix

<!--
This is reference material for deep dives. Skip unless specific questions arise during Q&A. These slides cover edge cases like semantic versioning rules, GitHub App setup, git identity for bots, and OIDC internals. Jump to specific slides as questions come up; they're here for completeness, not for presenting linearly.
