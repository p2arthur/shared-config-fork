# Shared Configs

ESLint + Prettier as npm packages

<!--
Configs are distributed via npm package, not GitHub refs. Install as a devDependency and import in your local config files. This gives you proper versioning, lock files, and the familiar update workflow. No special GitHub Action syntax needed. Let me show you how simple the setup looks in practice.
